------------------------------------
Dont use spaces  while naming a folder.Example: Jenkins docs,make is as "Jenkins_docs"
Step1: create a folder in  C:\  drive with the name "Jenkins".
>Jenkins is opensource.Jenkins power is mainly on its plugins.If we remove jenkins plugins then jenkins is useless.
Like playstore or app store for mobile,even in jenkins we do have https://plugins.jenkins.io/.
>Jenkins is one of the main tool in recent Devlopment methodologies.ie in Agile or scrum.
>Jenkins can be installed using below ways.
1)Using jenkins installer--not recommended for development,for training it is ok.
https://www.jenkins.io/download/thank-you-downloading-windows-installer-stable
2)using jenkins.war file--not recommended
3)jenkins.war deployment into tomcat/weblogic/jbos/glasfish servers....etc-recommnded
4)jenkins on AWS/Azure/GCp--recommended based on ur project budget
5)Jenkins can be installed on dockers or VM----highly recommended
https://labs.play-with-docker.com/
if you were not satisfied with services provided by jenkins,then u can use "CLOUDBEES".

Reason why plugins are failing?
1)might be we are using old jenkgins.war file.
2)Might be we are working jenkins in intranet.Due to firewall restrictions plugins are not getting installed on
your jenkins node.
3)Repository might having improper ssl certificate.
