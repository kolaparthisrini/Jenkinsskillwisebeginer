>>Goal:
Trainee shld be able to configure and start jenkins.
shld know hw to run the jobs and run pipelines
Autodeployments and staging introduction
troubleshooting and logging
------------------------------------
Dont use spaces  while naming a folder.Example: Jenkins docs,make is as "Jenkins_docs"
Step1: create a folder in  C:\  drive with the name "Jenkins".
>Jenkins is opensource.Jenkins power is mainly on its plugins.If we remove jenkins plugins then jenkins is useless.
Like playstore or app store for mobile,even in jenkins we do have https://plugins.jenkins.io/.
>Jenkins is one of the main tool in recent Devlopment methodologies.ie in Agile or scrum.
>Jenkins can be installed using below ways.
1)Using jenkins installer--not recommended for development,for training it is ok.
https://www.jenkins.io/download/thank-you-downloading-windows-installer-stable
2)using jenkins.war file--not recommended
3)jenkins.war deployment into tomcat/weblogic/jbos/glasfish servers....etc-recommnded
4)jenkins on AWS/Azure/GCp--recommended based on ur project budget
5)Jenkins can be installed on dockers or VM----highly recommended
https://labs.play-with-docker.com/
if you were not satisfied with services provided by jenkins,then u can use "CLOUDBEES".
--- 
Reason why plugins are failing?
1)might be we are using old jenkgins.war file.
2)Might be we are working jenkins in intranet.Due to firewall restrictions plugins are not getting installed on
your jenkins node.
3)Repository might having improper ssl certificate.

Day 3
------------
System configuration
Jenkins CLI: USe jenkins cli to create/delete/run/modify jobs,builds from cli.This cli is mainly used by jenkins Administrator.
Dashboard>Manage Jenkins>Jenkins CLI
>We can use "Java Melody" plugin to monitor master and slaves jenkin nodes.

 <role rolename="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script"/>
  
Deploy to conatiner:
  If we want to deploy any java app to tomcat web server,then the app shld be in below format.
  war,ear and jar
  War--web archive.USed for web apps.Example:Servlets,Springboot and spring mVC and jsps
  ear- Enterprise archive.USed for enterprise app like banking and insurance apps.Technology:EJB,Structs,Spring...etc
  Jar---Java archive.Used for desktop app or application s/w designed using Java Swing and AWT.
  
Goal: We need to deplay a Simple SpingMVC web app to Tomcat via Jenkins.
Prereq:Tomct
Code:

Assume i am working for 3 modules is Comcast.
1st--Finace Fund transfer
2nd---Reports
3---Email notificationl

Views are helpful when we have multiple jobs.for easy viewing and maintainance we can use viewws.
nousl
I want to build my code continously for every 10 or 15 mins with out manual involvement.


Pool SCM and Build Periodically.In reality we will use "QUARTZ" scheduler instead of Pool scm and Build periodically. H/5 * * * *.We can also use "Cron Schedulers"
>>Quartz is commercial.We need to purchase the plugin from Quartz
==============
>By default whene we are working in a project we will have firewall and proxy rules and regulations.And we dont have full access to internet.
>
To get access to internet,we need to provide proxy details like ipaddress,username and password.

To provide proxy details, Jenkins>Dashboard>Manage Jenkins>Manage Plugins>Advanced Settings
>>>

Master node is also called as Leader

Child node is called as Slave/follower.In enterprize projects,we shld have more than 2 jenkin servers.
How slaves communicate with jenkins master?It uses agents.

On which basis zookeeper identifies Leader?
ans)Zookeeper internally runs election algorithm and finds nearest leader.
A slave can be in cloud also.

1 slave in AWS,1 in GCP,1 in onpremises,but rules all shld be in same cluster.

https://zookeeper.apache.org/
==================================================
Day 4:
-----------------
Implement Master-slave architectur for ur jenkins.on.By default TCP port will be disabled in jenkins.
We need to enable the port.TCP and SSH
MAster and slave will use TCP protocol for communication

http://localhost:9000/env-vars.html/
Artifact archieving: Wen we build any maven project,then if build is success jenkins will create a folder ing with
the name "target".It is going to place the war file and its supported files under target folder.

Assume i am builng new build.ding my job for the 67th time,67 war files ,but in maven it wont persist old war files.simply it will delete the old war file while executing.
Artifact means files that are necessary to run ur app.
Pipeline as a code and its types/Groovy introduction
>>Pipeline creation thru plugin:

Pipeline: A pipeline is  sequence of jobs/stages or events that are used to achive a specific task. 

Till now we had controlled or configured everything thru mouse as it is GUI.

What ever i had done till now,i want the same thru automation.To perform the same using automation,we needto 
use Groovy DSL lang.

Using groovy,we are going to write pipelines.

Writing code  in pipeline is also called as "Pipeline as a code" concept.
Pipeline code can be written in 2 ways.
1)declarative approach---new approach--this is very easy to understand and debug.Useful for writing comploicated pipelines.
2)scripting approach---old approach

Always pipeline code will start with "pipeline"

pipeline {

//scripts
}

agent any{
}

stages is combinatiomn of multiple stages.Every stage has a step to perform.In our language step means task that we want to perform.
stages{

stage{
step{
 }
stage{ 
}
}

pipeline----agent----stages---stage--step
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Eclipse---->git----->github/bitbucket/gitlab---->UAT server---->Pre-production server----->production server

1approach:create a pipeline using plugins
we need to install Delivery pipeline plugin.

UAT Job>preprodJob>productionJ
>Till now we placed our pipeline code directly in jenkins which is not recommended approach.Always we suggest people to create a "Jenkinsfile" and write the code.here.after writing the code ,place it in github/bitbucket/gitlab/s3 bucket.
