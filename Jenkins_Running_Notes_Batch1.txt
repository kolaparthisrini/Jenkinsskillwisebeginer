jenkins is opensource.

Jenkins Installation steps:
Jenkins can be installed in multiple ways:Below are some of the ways
1)Using jenkins installer-----------------------Use this only for training or for R&D.https://www.jenkins.io/download/thank-you-downloading-windows-installer-stable/
2)Install jenkins on docker------------------USed mainly for production environments where containerization matters
we need to install docker first and on the top of that,we need to install jenkins.
3)As a war file ie jenkins.war-------traditional approach.used for training purpose and research.not recommended fordevelopment.
java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8181


4)jenkins war deployment on tomcat/weblogic/jboss/pramathi/glashfish server--used in development
5)On top of cloud ie AWS/Azure/GCP.....etc
6)cloudbees which an alternate option for jenkins can be used.https://www.cloudbees.com/--costly

docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins

Add description
jnkins was writen in java.
>jenkins is CI/CD server.Jenkins is previously called as Hudson server.2011
>Jenkins is totally writen in Java language.Some people call jenkins as Build server.
Alternativies to jenkins : cloud bees,Teamcity(microsoft),bamboos...etc
https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo

CI standnts for continous Integration.
CD stands for Continous Delivery.
>In olden days ie before jenkins or CI,evry day we might build the app only 1 time or max of 2.Nonw because of agile and scrum,on a daily basis whenever we are done withe code changes we shld be able to build the app,test the app and deploy the app avoiding long queues and long waiting time.
But now we can set auto approvals for the builds avoiding manual approvals.
>Jenkins follows MAster-slave architecture.
one machine/node will act as master/leader and others will work as Slave or childern.
>Using the above approach jenkins allows us to run multiple builds ata time,by reducing waiting time.
Team leader-master and team members-slaves---Ravi--13 years,raju-1 year,Vinoth-8 years,Sri
ni-Leader--14 years

If more no of builds are needed,then we will go with "MASTER-SLAVE" architecture.
>In master slave architectures,we will run election algorithm to identify leader and slaves.
>In realtime,we will use APACHE zookeeper server.
https://zookeeper.apache.org/
>A slave is a machine with jenkins software or agent.Some people call slave as node or terminal or machine.
>To work on master slave,we shld have a cluster.
>A cluster is a group of machines/nodes/servers/terminals.
>By defaault we will never have a cluster.Only machine will act as master.

>jenkins is making life easier by automation.
Example: running a specific task at 2:30am IST on evry day except on Sunday.Once build is success,an email shld be triggered to tarshana and her managr as well.or Once build is failed,an email shld be triggered to tarshana and her managr as well and an Jira/servicenow ticket shld be created.
>Jenkins power is mainly on plugins.Without plugin there is no jenkins.Plugin is like heart for a human body.
> By default jenkins can process 2 requests at a time.We can increase the jenkins capacity.

Developer writes the code in Eclipse/VScode------>Push the code to Git---->Git to github---->Sonarqube code quality testing----->Building the app------->test report generation---->if build success deploy to app server.

pre-build and post-build

Day3: 
====================================
>By default we can run only 2 jobs at a time.
Global tool configuration: we can configure jdk,maven,ant,any others s/w path
manage Plugins: we use this option to update/install/delete plugins from jenkins

To uninstall a plugin from jenkins: Manage jenkins>Plugin Manager>Installed Plugins>Click "*" symbol.


When we work for client project,we will have a separate network with firewall protection.Securty plays a major role
while installing plugins,all plugins cannot be installed?Hw to handle this?
ans)
Get credentials of ur proxy server from IT team. and update the same under :
Manage jenkins>Plugin Manager>Advanced Settings. and then click "Submit".

One of the drawback of jenkins in security is "We cannot create roles and permissions directly".Bu we can overcome the same using "RoleBased access" pluginwd.

I want to create a user with name "srini" as username and "srini" as pwd
Admin: kolaparthi srinivas--username:admintime,
User: srini,username: srini
>We shld not have more than 1 admin.
>in realtime,we will integrate LDAP server with Jenkins or we will integrate Kerberos or OKta/Oauth/SAML authentication with jenkins.
>How can i monitor jenkins?
Using "Melody" Plugin we can monitor jenkins.

Deploy to server  container:
=================================
>>war/ear are the allowed formats for web conatiner
>>for JAr JVM is enough.
Once coding and testing is completed,we ned to pack/bundle the entire code into one of the below formats.
war/ear/jar
war----web archieve
ear----enterprise archieve
jar---- java archieve
.java,
.war----for web app,  Techno:php,django,flask,jsp,servlets,Springboot...etc
.jar----for desktop apps:Any app which u install on ur machine is called as desktop app or application software
tech:Java Swing,AWT,GWT,Spring
.ear----for enteprise apps Example:ejb or spring,Structs,corba. 

Task: create  a web app,build it,test it and deploy the same into web server like tomcat/weblogic/jboss/Oracle servers/Pramathi/nginx.
we need to install "deploy to container" plugin.

<properties>
        <maven.compiler.release>17</maven.compiler.release>
</properties>
==========================
Pipeline creation
staging
Script introduction to pipeline
Articraft archieving
===============================
Day4

java -Dhudson.plugins.git.GitSCM.ALLOW_LOCAL_CHECKOUT=true -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9000

Master slave architecture slave and master shld be on same cluster.
project name: comcast

UAT(user acceptance server) server
Preproduction server
Production server

Developer writing the code-------commit-->git-push to -->github--->sonarqube--->Jenkins will pull data from branch ---->Post build filter---->report generation--->Tomcat(deployed to server)

java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://localhost:9000/manage/computer/Slave2/jenkins-agent.jnlp -secret 335513a26943965fecf350feabc644f83f1267388e6c5a8fbd7c64da44a82713 -workDir "D:\Slave2"

If master wants to communicate with slaves,then we need to use agents.

In reality to enable slaves and jobs,we need to use Groovy language.
>>Archive Build Artifacts:
==========================
When we build any maven project ,the final output will be either a jar file or war file.These files are located in target folder.
If i run 5 times the project,then how many war files will be created?\
ans)5 if there is code change and version change in each build.
1 if there is no code change.

i want to archive my old builds output.?How can i perform?

Build1-----abc.0.1.warfile
Build2-----abc.0.1.1.warfile  we need to archieve---tarsana
Build3-----abc.0.2.0.war===vinoth
>>Archive feature os by default available in ur jenkins
====================================================================
Pipeline:
---------
What ever operations that we had done till now are these done via coding or thru GUI?
Ans)GUI

If i add automation to this?
I will create a groovy file with the operations.ld be installed
in groovy,we are going to specify,on which agent we want to run the jobs,which job shld created,which plugins shld be installed.....etc.

groovy follows DSL syntax.JenkinsFile[instructions].put this file in github/bitbucket/gitlab and give that github link.This jenkins file concept is called as "Pipeline as a code".

==================
Wheneever we want to push code to production server,before that we shld do proper testing.

Eclipse--->git--->github--->Sonarqube(code quality testing)--->Jenkins---->UAT server--->Staging server--->pre-production server----->Production servers

A pipeline is a group of steps or stages or modules.Pipelpine creation can be done in 2 ways.
1)declarative approach---latest

will start with :
pipeline {

} What ever we write inside stage is userdefined.Stage and stages are keywords which are predefined.
2)scripting approach---older

DSL language
---->UAT(testing)--->Pre-production server---->production

I will create delivery ,which shld run uat first and then pre and production.---we are not going to write any groovy.We will use delivery pipeline plugin.

Using steps we are going to perform tasks
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/running-pipelines/
whene we want to run multiple builds or stages parallely,then we need use the keyword "parallel".

when we want to write pipeline in a separate file,then that code shld be places in JenkinsFile.This concept is c alled pipeline as a code and that file shld be placed in git or github repository.

https://github.com/kolaparthisrini/JenkinsPipelines

I want ro run my pipeline codeable which is available in my git from jenkins.
